## About

This plugin allows to customize locales via the OJS/OMP/OPS GUI. The default locales
are replaced but not overwritten and can easily be restored. A simple
documentation can be printed that lists all changes made to the locales. The
locales can be customized in the tab 'locale' in management > settings >
website. There is a search function for files and for locale keys within the
files. The documentation can be printed in the plugin's settings section.
